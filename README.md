# Pomodoro-app

My plan will be to code a simple Pomodoro-style productivity tool. This will have the basic functionality of a Pomodoro timer, as well as a personal todo list. Users can save and delete (complete) their tasks from the database, with the added benefit of coming back to finish them the next time they log in to their Pomodoro app.

A crucial functionality I would like to implement are the push notifications in the OS, so that the user will get notified without having to constantly look at the timer. Without the user stopping or skipping the timer sequence, the app will run according to the renowned Pomodoro scheme:

1. Working sequence starts (25 minutes).
2. App encourages user to end work and take a short break (5 minutes).
3. This will have completed one pomodoro. With fewer than three pomodoros, app loops back to Step 1.
4. After the fourth pomodoro the app sets a long break (30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 1.

Ideally, I would like this application to look visually appealing and potentially have some nice features (for example, a nice minimalistic counter). Main focus of my foundation project will still be to get the necessary functionality to work and implement personal logins and databases.

I will most probably be using HTML, CSS and Javascript for this project. Possibly Python and Flask for the database functionality.
